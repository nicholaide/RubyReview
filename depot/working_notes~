Notes:
ON DEPOT B
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  # this attr_accessible seems new
  attr_accessible :description, :image_url, :price, :title
  validates :title, :description, :image_url, presence: true
  # using 0.01 because database stores 0.001 as zero any
  validates :price, numericality: {greater_than_or_equal_to: 0.01}
  validates :title, uniqueness: true
  validates :image_url, allow_blank: true, format: {
	with: %r{\.(gif|jpg|png)$}i,
	message: 'must be a URL for GIF, JPG or PNG image.'
  }
end

ON DEPOT B
unit tests output does not show which tests are run, unlike in the book 
ON DEPOT B
base name of the YAML file must match the name of database table

DEPOT D
changing the root on config/routes.rb; need to delete the defauly public/index.html

root :to => 'store#index', as: 'store' (the latter tells Rails to create a store_path variable (we saw this with say_goodbye_path)

ON DEPOT E:
view-source:http://media.pragprog.com/titles/rails4/code/rails32/depot_e/app/views/layouts/application.html.erb

application.html.erb is a layout used for all views for all controllers that don't otherwise provide a layout

ON DEPOT E:
CSS selector notation: if starts with a number sign (#) match on id attributes; if . (dot) match on class attributes, else elements name

ON DEPOT E:

one final point before we move on: both validation and functional tests will
test the behavior of controllers only; they will not retroactively affect any
objects that already exist in the database or in fixtures. In the previous example,
two products contain the same title. Such data will cause no problems
and will go undetected up to the point where such records are modified and
saved.

SCSS commments  /*added by me*/

ON DEPOT F:
if a table has foreign keys, the corresponding  model should have a belongs_to for each


side note:

new ebook uses the order in store, while the 3.0 version uses default_scope in products.rb
class StoreController < ApplicationController
  def index
	@products = Product.order(:title)
  end
end

class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
default_scope :order => 'title'


ON DEPOT g:
error on line_items_controller_test.rb, see discussion on website. also, update test is different in 
generated script that on site, those in # are from site
